;Here we place an .ini-format config file
;The general format is:

;[object1_name]
;name1 = val1
;name2 = val2

;[object2_name]
;enable_serial_debug = true
;pin = 7
;ip = 192.168.1.1
;subdevice_list = child1_name,child2_name
;etcetera etcetera

;I would like to use YML or some other format, but I haven't found a library I like yet.
;ini works for now:
; - it has section breaks
; - it allows comments
; - the library for it is very good.
